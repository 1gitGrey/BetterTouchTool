#Introduction 

This documentation is currently being written (June, 2, 2016). **During the next few days and weeks content will be added continuously.**

The (very old) BTT documentation is available via [https://blog.boastr.net/?page_id=1619](https://blog.boastr.net/?page_id=1619). For more information about BetterTouchTool please visit [https://boastr.net](https://boastr.net)

If you want to contribute topics to this documentation, I'd love to add your contributions or additional languages. I'll soon put this documentation somewhere on Github so everybody can contribute.
