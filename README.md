## BetterTouchTool Documentation
Merge requests on the BetterTouchTool documentation are always very welcome.

To build the BetterTouchTool Documentation follow these steps:
* Install Node.js (I recommend to use nvm to install Node. Current long term support version of Node.js is v6.9.1).
* Run npm install -g gitbook-cli
* cd into the BetterTouchToolDocs directory and run ``node yarn-0.17.10.js install``
* run gitbook serve to build and run the documentation
* run gitbook build to just build the documentation
